            <h2>A problem to solve</h2>
            <p>For our second semester exam project, we had to find a client in need of a website. We found Zoja,
                an artist, who wanted to showcase more than a hundred of her art pieces on her portfolio, that needed a
                redesign, too.
                Uploading that many images would have been a bad idea - performance wise -, so we had to come up with a
                way to keep the website as lightweight as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-desc1 reveal">
            <h2>Development process</h2>

            <p>I was responsible for developing the website, following the design provided by my group members. For the
                technical realization of the product, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript were used. The images were optimized with Adobe Photoshop
                to improve the overall SEO and to make the website more lightweight. To ensure that the website is
                dynamic and loads fast, the art pieces
                were first uploaded to WordPress into private posts, with Advanced Custom Fields.
            </p>
            <p>The use of Advance Custom Fields helped to structure the information about the art pieces
                and get it ready to display later on the website through the Rest API of WordPress, using it as a
                headless CMS. The API transfers the data,
                and we are able to display the image and the related metadata with the use of JavaScript. We managed to
                implement functional elements in the code, such as breadcrumbs, call-to action buttons (‘Read more’,
                ‘Full list’), a well-defined navigation that turns into a burger menu
                when adjusting to mobile screens, a “to the top” button, and a fully working contact form through an API
                called web3forms.</p>

            <h2> Responsiveness and SEO
            </h2>
            <p>As for the responsiveness of the multimedia product, we mostly used view-width, view-height,
                percentages, and rems. We avoided using fixed units that would limit the responsiveness. Most
                elements of the website were built using the grid system of CSS, as it makes the media query
                adjustments easier. The burger menu was implemented with Bootstrap, which is an open source library of
                well
                tested components.</p>

            <p>SEO measures were also implemented, in the form of respecting semantic structures,
                optimizing all featured images and giving them fitting alt texts. The product turned out to be
                17 megabytes in total, making it quite fast to load, which we considered a success as the index
                page loaded in only 204ms with disabled cache and no throttling (with fast internet
                connection). The last step of the process was the validation of code, which concluded the development of
                the product.</p>
