About

Hello there! 

I'm Bal√°zs, a 25 years old multimedia design student currently studying at UCN Aalborg.
If I had to describe myself briefly, I'd say that I am an open minded and friendly guy, 
who's always ready to explore and learn new stuff.
During my marketing studies, the most interesting part for me was the huge deal of opportunity that lies
in online marketing - and within that - social media and content creation. Because people generally don't like ads, right? The people want useful, relevant or entertaining content, or the mix of those.
In my final thesis, I explored new marketing trends, in the form of viral marketing and the so called "meme marketing".
The title of my research was "The role of memes and the study of viral content in marketing communication". 

So how did I end up in Denmark learing about multimedia design and web development? Being a DIY guy, I wanted to understand
and eventually learn how to develop web solutions, but the marketing curriculum only touched that part briefly.
Coding was something that I wanted to get into for a long time. I also wanted to move abroad to challenge myself and
to further develop my language skills. So there came the idea of moving to Denmark to study multimedia design
and learn a lot more about web development, ux/ui and content creation. And I'm so happy I did, one of the best decisions of my life!


I'll also write a bit about what I enjoy doing in my free time.
