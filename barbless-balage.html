            <h2>Barbless Balage on Instagram</h2>
            <p>I’ve had a passion for fishing since childhood that I still practice with great fondness. I have a deep
                love
                for being out there in the nature with a few lures, a rod and a net. For me, the real glory of fishing
                doesn’t come from catching the prey, it comes from letting them swim back to their living abyss as
                intact
                as possible. This sport doesn’t have to be harmful for the nature, that’s why I popularize using
                barbless
                hooks and that’s why I’ve become and advocate of sustainable sportfishing. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-desc1 reveal">
            <h2>What makes this a project?</h2>

            <p>My goal with this blog is to share my experiences and my ways of sustainable sportfishing with
                Instagram’s
                huge
                angling community.</p>

            <p>In order to send my message to as many as possible, I manage my blog with care for aesthetics and
                interesting
                content. I often share unconventional and educational methods that inspire other anglers to be more
                careful
                and
                sustainable when it comes to fishing. It should be our shared goal to treat our nature with care so that
                the
                next generations can also enjoy it.</p>

            <h2> The everchanging algorithm of IG</h2>

            <p>In order to deliver my message organically to as many as possible, I have to make efforts to please
                Instagram’s algorithm. There are certain steps one could do while sharing posts, and these steps make
                your
                post more favourable in the “eyes” of IG’s AI.

                Ultimately, IG has one goal: to keep their users attention on the platform for as long as possible. For
                that, they need sharable posts that make the user want to engage with them. On top of respecting
                composition guidelines, like the rule of thirds, it’s also important to fill out the posts with as much
                information as you can, such as location, relevant hashtags, tagged people and interesting captions that
                provoke comments.</p>

            <h2> New trend on social media</h2>
            <p> Recently, with the rise of TikTok and short videos, IG’s algorithm rewards the users who upload REELs.
                These
                short videos on the platform, if done well, perform way better than regular image posts. The reason for
                that
                is simple: IG shows them to more people. This is their way to make you upload more short videos.
                Although, just uploading a simple short video is obviously not a recipe that will always get you
                thousands or millions of views. However, there are certain
                factors that will greatly increase your chances. </p>
            <img src="assets/images/reelmockup.png" style="width: 25vw;" id="reelmockup" alt="instagram reel mockup">
            <p>According to a study, there are 6 key
                factors that make content go viral (Shifman 2014). The 6P consists of Positivity - which means that a
                humorous content
                will be shared more
                often. A content that Provokes high arousal emotions (shocking, sad, wholesome etc.) will also get more
                attention. Packaging means that the way the message is presented and delivered is also super important.
                Briefly saying, the more striking and shorter, the better. Prestige refers to the importance of the
                sender of the message. If someone well respected shares a post within a community, it will perform
                better. That's why it became so popular in marketing communication to work with influencers.
                Positioning means that the content should be tailored to a certain segment of people, and shared in
                their community. And finally, encouraging people to Participate by asking them to do something, like
                write a comment or perform an action.</p>

            <p>In my experience, taking these factors in consideration when making content won't always make the
                viewcount skyrocket, but
                they definitely increase the chances of a post to perform well.</p>

            <h2>The most important metric on IG</h2>
            <p>The best way to measure effectiveness on Instagram is calculating the engagement rate. It can be done by
                counting the avarage reactions on a post, then dividing that number by the sum of followers, then
                finally multiplying this by 100. According to Google, generally speaking (as it can vary in different
                sectors) an engagement rate of above 6% can be considered as very high. That being said, my ER of around
                12% is an indicator that what I'm doing on my profile is interesting to my audience. </p>
